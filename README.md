# Project1

I couldn't get the images to look exactly the right size as the mockup pdf.
I also couldn't really get the correct font style of the mockup pdf.

Also, I was confused on the instructions for this project, it said to make it look like the mockup, but then it said to add
your own pictures and create more stuff etc etc.

So I'm just turning in what I have now (to look like the mockup). Thanks.
